EXPLANATION:
Here, when a is forked a P1(A) and it's child P2(B) is created.IF (P2 is a child then In P2(B) when b is forked , P4(D) is created)  ELSE(c is forked , P3(B) is created (In P3(B) , c is forked i.e P5(E) is created. IF ( P5(E) is a child , d is forked , P6(F) is created )). Hence A,B,C,D,E,F are shown with their child id and parent id.
